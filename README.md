# temirlantoktabek.com

Developed as a personal project, this website is an attempt to create a personal website that would reflect my work experience, link my projects and have a way for people to connect with me. In an attempt to strip away all that is unneeded, I turned to the best designers in the field and was inspired by Ian Spalter's (head of design at Instagram) personal website - IanSpalter.com - and wanted to replicate and build on top of it. This is an on-going project where I am also learning the basics of front-end development.

Cheers,
Tim
